## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Dataset
The dataset provided for this project was the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI.

## Script
The run_analysis.R script as written achieves the following:
1. Sets up the R libraries necessary
2. Downloads data and unzips it if not already present in the working directory
3. Reads the data into datatables
4. Merges the datatables to create a master datatable
5. Extracts desired data and renames it so it can be understood
6. Exports the final dataset
